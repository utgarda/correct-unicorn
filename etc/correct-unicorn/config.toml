# Minimum dictionary requirements

# Character substitutions for password complexity requirements
# Applied when --require-special-chars or similar flags are used
# Only substitutes MINIMUM needed (e.g., one number, one special char)
# to satisfy arbitrary complexity requirements while keeping memorability
[substitutions]
# Priority order for substitutions (applied until requirements met)
'o' = '0'   # Number (first priority)
'a' = '@'   # Special character (second priority)
'e' = '3'   # Alternative number
'i' = '!'   # Alternative special char
's' = '$'   # Alternative special char
# Add more as needed for different complexity requirements

# Future system-wide options (not yet implemented):
#
# # Default word count (can be overridden by CLI --words flag)
# default-word-count = 4
#
# # Enforce security requirements
# [security]
# require-unique-words = true
# allow-numbers-in-words = false
